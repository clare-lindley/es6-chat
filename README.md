# es6-chat

This is a very simple application based on the example in this post: https://socket.io/get-started/chat/. I've set up the socket.io chat app and I'm adding the suggested features in the Homework section at the end of the post.


## Install
`npm install`

## Usage
`npm start`  

View the app up and running at: http://localhost:3000/

## Tests
`npm test`
